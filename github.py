# when a grp of 3-4 people works on a project, then they have to merge their files at one place
# Ex: instead of share code on mails, dropbox, we use github,gitlab, bitbucket
# GIT -  DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM , how can we push opur project to github repository
# u can think repository as a folder- where u can put all ur files , online storage like g-drive & dropbox
# To save a file: click on commit file
# files ki history ko save krke rkhta hai git,
